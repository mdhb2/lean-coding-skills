# LCS Prototype Skill

Shared Coding Contract: Refer to `../lcs-shared/contract.md` for folder conventions, Handoff format, and token optimization.

**Purpose:** Build throwaway code to answer a specific design question.

**Chain of Truth Level:** Strict

## OKF Frontmatter & Writing Safety

When creating artifacts, include YAML frontmatter following the schema in `../lcs-shared/contract.md`. Follow Artifact Writing Safety rules: generate content first, write one file, verify, stop on failure.

### Trigger

Activate when user wants to: validate an approach, build a proof of concept, test a design question, or create throwaway code.

### Behavior Checklist

1. **Pick the branch:**
   - "Does the logic/state model feel right?" → **LOGIC branch:** Single HTML file with state panel and free-play buttons.
   - "What will it look like?" → **UI branch:** Multiple variations switchable via URL params.

2. **Rules:**
   - Throwaway by day one. Trivial to run. No persistence by default.
   - Skip polish (no tests, no abstractions).
   - Surface state after every action.

3. Create prototype in `.lcs/work-items/{ts}-{slug}/prototype/`.

4. **Capture the decision:** Once validated, fold the decision into real code/spec. Archive the prototype code as a throwaway git branch. Leave a context pointer in the PRD/SRS.

5. End with Handoff to `lcs-toprd` or `lcs-tosrs`.

### Output

- `.lcs/work-items/{ts}-{slug}/prototype/` — isolated throwaway prototype

## Chain of Truth Report

### Level
Strict

### Sources Checked
- `.lcs/state.md`
- <PRD/explore sections being validated>

### Assumptions
- <label each [verified] or [unverified]>

### Actions Taken
- <Prototype built, branch picked (LOGIC/UI), validation run>

### Verification
- <Prototype ran successfully; decision captured and folded back>

### Report
<Explicit pass/fail on the design question being validated>
