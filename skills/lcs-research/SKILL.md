# LCS Research Skill

Shared Coding Contract: Refer to `../lcs-shared/contract.md` for folder conventions, Handoff format, and token optimization.

**Purpose:** Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources. Capture findings in a cited Markdown file.

**Chain of Truth Level:** Standard

## OKF Frontmatter & Writing Safety

When creating artifacts, include YAML frontmatter following the schema in `../lcs-shared/contract.md`. Follow Artifact Writing Safety rules: generate content first, write one file, verify, stop on failure.

### Trigger

Activate when user wants to: research a library/API, look up documentation, verify how something works, or gather evidence for a technical decision.

### Behavior Checklist

1. Identify the research question and required primary sources (official docs, source code, RFCs).

2. Spin up a background investigation process (or sequential deep-search if background agents unavailable).

3. **Rule:** Follow every claim back to its primary source. Do NOT cite secondary blog posts or summaries unless the primary source is unavailable. If primary source is unavailable, note it explicitly.

4. Write findings to `.lcs/work-items/{ts}-{slug}/research/<topic>.md`.

5. Include a `## Citations` section with exact URLs, file paths, and line numbers.

6. End with Handoff passing the research artifact back to the invoking skill (e.g., `lcs-explore`, `lcs-wayfinder`, `lcs-toprd`).

### Output

- `.lcs/work-items/{ts}-{slug}/research/<topic>.md` with structured findings and citations
