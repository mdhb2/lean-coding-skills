description: Use this skill whenever the user asks to finalize completed work into canonical documentation. Trigger on "finalize documentation", "prepare final-doc", "lcs-doc-finalizer", "selesaikan dokumentasi". Ensure all tasks are marked done, generate map.md and doc.md under .lcs/docs/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/, recommend git commit and PR description, move source artifacts under .lcs/work-items/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/ to .lcs/archive/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/ and delete source folder.

# LCS Doc Finalizer Skill

Shared Coding Contract
- Refer to Shared Coding Workflow Contract in `../lcs-shared/contract.md` for folder conventions, Handoff format, and token optimization.

Purpose
- Consolidate completed work into high-quality documentation.
- Save documentation under `.lcs/docs/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/` as two separate files:
  1. `map.md` (adapted from `aido-map` context map structure)
  2. `doc.md` (adapted from `aix-doc-finalizer` final-doc structure)

Trigger
- Activate when the user requests to "finalize documentation", "prepare final-doc", "lcs-doc-finalizer", "selesaikan dokumentasi", or similar.

Behavior checklist
1. Read `.lcs/state.md` to identify the active work-item directory: `.lcs/work-items/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/`.
2. Scan the task folder `.lcs/work-items/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/task/` and read all task files (`task-###.md`).
3. Verify all task files are marked `Status: done`.
   - If any task is NOT done (e.g., `pending` or `blocked`), alert the user, list the incomplete tasks, and ask if they wish to proceed anyway or continue executing tasks first.
4. Read `.lcs/work-items/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/prd-enhanced.md` (fallback to `prd.md` if enhanced version is missing) and `explore.md` to capture context.
5. Create the following directories if they do not exist:
   - `.lcs/docs/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/` — output target for documentation files.
   - `.lcs/archive/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/` — archive target for source artifacts.
6. Generate `.lcs/docs/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/map.md` mapping the exact files changed or created during this work-item.
7. Generate `.lcs/docs/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/doc.md` consolidating the functional changes, verification steps, git commit recommendations, and PR description.
8. Update `.lcs/state.md` with:
   - `current_phase: finalization`
   - `timestamp: <current-ISO-timestamp>`
   - `last_session_note: Finalized documentation for <slug-work-item>`
9. Generate or update `.lcs/docs/docs-index.md` by scanning all subdirectory items under `.lcs/docs/` and listing their `doc.md` and `map.md` with timestamps and descriptions extracted from `map.md` Description or `doc.md` Objective in a clean table.
10. Move all source artifacts under `.lcs/work-items/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/` to `.lcs/archive/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/`, then delete the source folder `.lcs/work-items/<timestamp>-<slug-work-item>/` completely.
    - **Guard:** Only proceed with move and delete if both `map.md` and `doc.md` were successfully generated in step 6 and 7. If either file is missing, abort this step and alert the user.
11. End with a Handoff section.
